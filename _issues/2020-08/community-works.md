There are also many awesome content being created by RetroAchievements community. And in the last month was a really special one...

## RAPodcast

It's a podcast hosted by 3 hardcore gamers of our community: {% rauser Draco655 %}, {% rauser BendyHuman %} and {% rauser Shootzy %}.

If you didn't check it yet, [click here and go to their youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIGdJGxrzmNYMaAGPsk2sIA).


## Thoreau's channel ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

The member {% rauser Thoreau %} started to produce some really awesome videos for the portuguese speaker community. There are game reviews, interviews with RA members ([me included](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtXbugukhAU) ðŸ˜‡), and tutorials about how to create achievements.

If you love RetroAchievements and know portuguese, I'm sure you'll love his videos!
