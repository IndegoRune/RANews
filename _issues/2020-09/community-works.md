This section exists to show off the work being done by RetroAchievement fans and that impressed the RA-staff.

## RAPodcast

In the last RANews issue I posted here about the RAPodcast. Turns out that it's now **The Official RetroAchievements Podcast&trade;**!

You can [check here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49vgbPt9MWA) the episode where I was interviewed and surprise the hosts inviting them to be staff members and make their show our official podcast. :)

If you like RetroAchievements, you're gonna subscribe our podcast, right?! ;)

## Dancarnate - Retro Achievement Review

The user {% rauser Dancarnate %} started a series on youtube called "Retro Achievement Reviews". Where he does a review on a game he have mastered and then give some tips/resources for others to use so they can get some of the tougher achievements mastered as well.
