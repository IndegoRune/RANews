## What's RANews?

RANews is a monthly webzine that aims to summarize what is happening/had happened in the RetroAchievements scene over the last month.


## Quick Overview

What to expect from this issue.


### HotCheevs Monthly

List of achievement sets releaset in the last month.

In August we got the impressive number of **83 brand new sets being released**! When I joined this site I'd never imagine we would reach this rate!


### Play This Set

Community members talking about their favorite sets and why you should play them. Cool stuff!


### Most Wanted Games

List of games with no achievement sets that community is excited to see. Hopefully it can encourage some achievement creators to pick a game and create a set for it.


### Top Players

Some statistics about the top 300 players of RetroAchievements and how they progressed over the last month.


### Current Events

List of running events that are open to join.


### Revisions and Rescores

Which sets got a revision or a rescore over the last month.


### Art Updates

Which sets got their game icons and/or badges changed over the last month.


### DevTip

Achievement creators sharing their tricks.

This month {% rauser wilhitewarrior %} shares a tutorial about pointers and how to use the Add Address feature.


### Fun

Mixing games with videogames and RetroAchievements. Really funny stuff being created by {% rauser StingX2 %}.

In this issue we have another bingo and also an honorable mention of the last month's bingo winner.


### Community Works

Showing off what the RetroAchievements fans are producing outside from here.


### Nerd Corner

Articles covering more technical aspects of the RetroAchievements project. Trying to bridge the gap between endusers and the crazy nerds who do the hardwork, creating the tools we use to have a lot of fun.

I'm starting this segment of RANews talking a about how the libretro project is so important for us, at RetroAchievements, and a bit about the cyber attack they suffered on the last month.


## How to Contribute

If you have an idea for an article to be posted in the next RANews, please go to the {% rauser RAdmin %} profile page and send us a message.

Keep in mind that the article must be written in markdown format. If you don’t know it, you can learn it in 10 minutes following this online tutorial here: <https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/> (it’s pretty similar to what you may be already using on discord).
