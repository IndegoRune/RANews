## What's RANews?

RANews is a monthly digital magazine that aims to summarize what is happening/had happened in the RetroAchievements scene over the last month.


## How to Contribute

If you have an idea for an article to be posted in the next RANews, please go to the {% rauser RAdmin %} profile page and send us a message.

Keep in mind that the article must be written in markdown format. If you don’t know it, you can learn it in 10 minutes following this online tutorial here: <https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/> (it’s pretty similar to what you may be already using on discord).


## Quick Overview

What to expect from this issue.

### Editorial

Starting in this issue we're going to have an editorial page. And for this issue
we're going to use that page to spread the word about the RetroAchievements Manifesto.


### HotCheevs Monthly

List of achievement sets released in the last month.


### Play This Set

Community members talking about their favorite sets and why you should play them. Cool stuff!


### RAGuide

In this issue we're starting to publish a guide to master an achievement set.

As we're on october, {% rauser ikki5 %} sent to us a guide for a spooky game: Ghoul School (NES).

**ALERT!** The guides usually contains spoilers about the game.


### Badge Quest

Our friend (and podcaster) {% rauser Bendyhuman %} challenged himself to master one game per day for a whole month, **and he did it!** Not only did but also wrote a mini-review about each game he mastered.

Really cool article that made me want to try some of those games.


### Top Players

Some statistics about the top 300 players of RetroAchievements and how they progressed over the last month.


### Most Wanted Games

List of games with no achievement sets that community is excited to see. Hopefully it can encourage some achievement creators to pick a game and create a set for it.


### Current Events

List of running events that are open to join.


### Revisions and Rescores

Which sets got a revision or a rescore over the last month.


### Art Updates

Which sets got their game icons and/or badges changed over the last month.


### Fun

Mixing games with videogames and RetroAchievements. Really funny stuff being created by {% rauser StingX2 %}.

In this issue we have another bingo and also an honorable mention of the last month's bingo winner.


### Community Works

Showing off what the RetroAchievements fans are producing outside from here.
